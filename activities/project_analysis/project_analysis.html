		<h4>Site Intent</h4>
			<p>The primary intent of the ChristChurchSeattle.org is to connect with parishioners of Christ Episcopal Church and to encourage attendance from University of Washington students and local residents. The objective of the Christ Church Seattle redesign is to address the function and aesthetics of the site design. We will also incorporate a responsive design with a focus on mobile devices. </p>
			
			<p>The current site design is difficult to navigate and lacks focal elements. Incorporating the principles and elements of design into the IA will enhance the composition and aid UX. We will also implement current web standards for HTML and CSS, as defined by the W3C, to improve cross browser support and mobile access. By linking to external style sheets, we will be able to “clean up” the code. Semantic markup will also improve readability and user access when future alterations to the content become necessary.</p>

				<tr>
					<td>Mars Hill Church</td>
					<td>http://marshill.com/udistrict</td>
					<td>I like the fonts and the social media links. Overall the design is off balance, images aren't browser compatible. The navigation is inspiring. It is almost as if the navigation dropdowns were designed by a diffent person than the rest of the site.</td>

		<h4>Target Audience</h4>
		
			<p>Our target audience are the local u-district residents. The majority are young and most of their internet browsing is done on a mobile device.</p>

			<p><strong>User Profile #1</strong></p>
				<p>Andrea is twenty-eight and lives with her boyfriend Chris in Seattle’s U-District. Neither have been previously married and they are both childless. They both work full time and previously attended the University of Washington, where they met. </p>
				<p>Andrea commuted from her parent’s house on the eastside while attending University and missed the experience of "living in Seattle". So they pay far to much for their apartment and the location is inconvenient to both of their work commutes. Nevertheless, they have a great view of the space needle from their living room windows, they have made friends with most of their neighbors, and they are within walking distance of several popular hangouts.</p>
				<p>Andrea attending church growing up, but hasn’t attended since moving to Seattle. If she is going to get up on Sunday morning, after a late Saturday night, she wants a church that is closer to her apartment. She searches local churches with her mobile device. Andrea is also looking for a church that others her age might attend. She is worried about feeling out of place among couples with children and the elderly.</p>

			<p><strong>User Profile #2</strong></p>
				<p>Ju is nineteen and a sophomore at the University of Washington. He lives in a studio apartment near campus. This is his first time living away from home. He completed his Freshman year at his local community college, so he doesn’t know many people in the area yet.</p> 
				<p>Ju loves soccer and his favorite team are the Seattle Sounders. He enjoys being outdoors and playing intermural sports. He is an engineering major and hopes to get a summer internship with Boeing.</p>
				<p>Raised in a Christian home, Ju is searching for local churches that others his age attend. He enjoys spending time with people of similar morals and interest.</p>
