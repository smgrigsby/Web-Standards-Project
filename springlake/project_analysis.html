		<h4>Site Intent</h4>
			<p>The primary intent of the Spring Lake Elementary website is to inform visitors of school policies and events. The objective of the Spring Lake Elementary re-design is to consolidate and reorganize the site content in order to improve visitor traffic and overall site usability. The re-design will also address the validation errors in the source code and the poor cross browser support.</p>

			<p>Firstly, we will address the function and aesthetics of the site design. Incorporating the principles and elements of design into the IA will enhance the composition and aid UX. </p>

			<p>Secondly, we will implement current web standards for HTML and CSS, as defined by the W3C, to improve cross browser support and mobile access. By linking to external style sheets, we will be able to “clean up” the code. Semantic markup will also improve readability and user access when future alterations to the content become necessary. </p>

		<h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
			<p>Spring Lake Elementary is part of Seminole County Public School, which receives more web traffic than almost any other county in Florida.* There are 36 other public elementary school within Seminole County. Within two miles of Spring Lake Elementary, there are three private elementary schools and one public elementary school.</p>

			<p>I have analyzed the websites of the four schools within the two mile radius of Spring Lake Elementary; Champion Preparatory Academy, Center Academy: Altamonte Springs, Forest City Elementary School, and Sweetwater Episcopal Academy. One feature the other sites share, but that Spring Lake Elementary lacks, is a streamlined global navigation. Regardless of aesthetics, the clearly defined IA improves the usability and UX.</p> 

			<p><strong>keywords</strong>: Spring Lake Elementary, Altamonte Springs Schools, Seminole County Public Schools, Florida Schools, Spring Lake School, Elementary Schools, Grade Schools, School Registration</p>

			<p><div class="footnote">*As of June 28, 2012; Broward County received 9.65% of the web traffic  amongst Florida County Public School Districts. Palm Beach received 7.99% and Seminole County received 7.28%.</div></p>
		
		<h4>Target Audience</h4>
		
			<p>Our target audience are mothers with preschool and/or elementary age children. These women are between the ages of 35-44, they have at least some college education, a yearly gross income between 60k-100k and primarily browse from a home computer. </p>

			<p><strong>User Profile #1</strong></p>
				<p>Traci is 37 years old and a mother of three children under the age of 18. Her two younger children are 3 and 5. Traci and her husband are house shopping for a larger home for their growing family. They have found a few locations they love, but with two children entering elementary school, Traci is researching school districts before they buy. Her oldest child, from a previous marriage, is in the 9th grade so Traci knows from experience what to look for in a school for her younger children. 

				<p>Traci and her husband both work fulltime, so they want a school that keeps them informed of school news and events. Traci doesn’t have much time in her day to browse on the internet and when she does it is from her home computer. She needs a school website that is easy to navigate so she can find what she is looking for. </p>

			<p><strong>User Profile #2</strong></p>
				<p>Leah’s daughter is a current student at Spring Lake Elementary. Leah is 41 and a stay at home mom. She enjoys staying involved in her daughter’s school. She is a PTA member and frequently volunteers at school events. She wishes there was a way to help more parents get involved. </p>

				<p>Leah subscribes to Parenting magazine and likes to watch Good Morning America after she drops her daughter off at school and is concerned by all the stories about school bullying and other emotional issues children cope with. </p>
